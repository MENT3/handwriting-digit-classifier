# Handwriting Digit Classifier

A small project to learn how to use a machine learning model in production.
It's unconventional but it works and for a small project it's enough

# How To Use

Run the project

```bash
python app.py
```

And use a HTTP client to make a HTTP call to the API with the file you want test.
The API just return the model prediction
